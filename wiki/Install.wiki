= Installation instructions =
  # Download the latest Metasploit Framework (MSF) release: http://www.metasploit.com/download/
  # Install Metasploit Framework
  # Update Ruby to 1.9 if not already done
  # Download XSSF from the SVN (svn export http://xssf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ XSSF) or from the last packaged version
  # Copy and paste all downloaded files into the Metasploit ~/msf3/ folder
  # Note that you can directly use 'svn export' command within ~/msf3/ folder. Please don't use 'svn checkout' command for XSSF within ~/msf3/ directory, that would break MSF legitimate '.svn' files, and break futures MSF updates !
  # Enjoy!
